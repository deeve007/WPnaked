WP Naked
============

A totally naked starter theme for Wordpress projects.

Super minimal theme both front end and back end, adding as little bloat as possible.

With none of those custom functions, or funny naming conventions that so many other "blank" theme developers seem to force on you. Wordpress default or generic naming conventions and functions have been followed to enable you to make the theme totally yours for your next Wordpress project.

Includes by default:
- fluidvids.js to display embeded videos responsively at 100% width.
- html5shiv.js for ie9 and below support of HTML5 elements.

Reset v Normalize
-----------------

One of those CSS battles going on... I really do understand the preference for Normalize by many, but I just find starting from a "blank slate" faster to work with in Wordpress. Open for debate on this, and this theme is always open for change down the track.
